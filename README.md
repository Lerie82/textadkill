## TextAdKill
This is a Chrome Extension that will remove ads from websites that normally have super laggy UI and functionality. This is due to the amount of advertisements above (and below) the fold when you are visiting the website. This extension is still in a very early release, but it's open source, so why not just push it. The name **TextAdKill** is the name the software was given when all it did was sit there and kill the rotating advertisements on free texting platforms, and it doesn't need to change.

## Installation
> __NOTE__: You must have Developer Mode enabled (slider; top right of the Extensions Settings page)

(1) Clone this repository **or** Download the zip file. (2) Then, click the **Load Unpacked** button on the Chrome Extensions Settings page (you can see the point below to get to the Extensions Settings page), locate the "root folder" (where you unzipped the zip file at).

### Chrome Extensions Settings
You can simple paste the link below in your Chrome browser to bring up the Extensions Settings.

### "Supported" Sites
I ad sites as I get them. Future versions may have implementations for "shared" or "custom" Advertising Block Lists.
