## TextAdKill
This is a Chrome Extension that will remove ads from websites that normally have super laggy UI and functionality. This is due to the amount of advertisements above (and below) the fold when you are visiting the website. This extension is still in a very early release, but it's open source, so why not just push it. The name **TextAdKill** is the name the software was given when all it did was sit there and kill the rotating advertisements on free texting platforms, and it doesn't need to change.

### Who?
I am a software developer, computer security researcher, no-teamer, and this little project will probably push the boundaries of my expert level software skills with Javascript, so don't be nice, be cruel, learning thrives in an unstable environment.

### Why?
1. It's my browsing experience, my browser, my code, I can do with it as I please.
2. I don't want 90% of my screen clogged with advertising. My screen.

### "Supported" Sites
I ad sites as I get them. Future versions may have implementations for "shared" or "custom" Advertising Block Lists.
