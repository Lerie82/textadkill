This is a Chrome Extension that will remove ads from websites that normally have super laggy UI and functionality. This is due to the amount of advertisements above (and below) the fold when you are visiting the website. The name is from my old software I created that would kill just ads on texting based websites (such as "pinger type" sites). You will get faster page loads and get rid of annoying ads with a single click of the button.

### Chrome Web Store
You can download the extension from the Web Store here: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/textadkill/hjebehoaeafhflpfimaiegaadhblidfp?hl=en&authuser=0

## Dev Installation
> __NOTE__: You must have Developer Mode enabled (slider; top right of the Extensions Settings page, unless you downloaded this from the Chrome Web Store)

(1) Clone this repository **or** Download the zip file. (2) Then, click the **Load Unpacked** button on the Chrome Extensions Settings page (you can see the point below to get to the Extensions Settings page), locate the "root folder" (where you unzipped the zip file at).
